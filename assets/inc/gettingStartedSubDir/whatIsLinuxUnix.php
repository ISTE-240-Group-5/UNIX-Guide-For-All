<p class="text">

Linux and Unix, referred to in this guide simply as “Unix” are both computer operating systems. Linux is heavily based on the Unix operating system, therefore they are similar in many areas.  For our purposes, this includes the command line interface called a “Shell”.  This interface is used for interpreting commands and translating them to perform an action on the computer.  This includes tasks such as creating, moving, or deleting files. The shell is commonly referred to as the Terminal, and will be referred to as such in this guide.
